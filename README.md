This folder contains a scanner project for the compiler, called allenscanner, that converts the input program into a sequence of tokens. The allenscanner program reads the input characters and produces a sequence of tokens for the parser. This project itself contains a README.md, four java class files, two versions of the SDD, a jflex file, and it will contain one input text file for testing.
