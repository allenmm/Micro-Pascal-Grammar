This folder contains a scanner project for a micro pascal grammar compiler. The scanner converts the input program into a sequence of tokens, reads the input characters, and produces a sequence of tokens for the recognizer. The recognizer is a recursive descent parser that checks to see if the input for a non-terminal method is a pascal program described by the micro pascal grammer. If it is, the grammar rule is executed. The Symbol Table is a hash map that will store information about the variable, program, array, function, or procedure identifiers found in the pascal program. 

This project contains a README.md, nine java class files, two versions of the SDD, a jflex file, three pascal test files, and it will contain one input text file for testing.
